# CS50 SQL CLASS

<https://cs50.harvard.edu/sql/>

    This is my CS50's SQL class assignments repository. I will also be learning about SQLAlchemy-ORM in tandem. 
    The idea is to have more practice with SQL and learn a useful, industry grade tool for managing databases with Python.
    
    Will use LLM's help to generate the boilerplate code for SQLAlchemy-ORM exercises. Eventually, before finishing the course, 
    I will stop using the LLM's help for this part. The idea is to use a Gradual Evolution of Complexity tactic 
    in order to learn the tools well.

## COURSE EXPLANATION

    Learn how to create, read, update, and delete data with relational databases, which store data in rows and columns. 
    Learn how to model real-world entities and relationships among them using tables with appropriate types, triggers,
    and constraints. Learn how to normalize data to eliminate redundancies and reduce potential for errors. 
    Learn how to join tables together using primary and foreign keys. Learn how to automate searches with views and expedite
    searches with indexes. Learn how to connect SQL with other languages like Python and Java. 
    Course begins with SQLite for portability’s sake and ends with introductions to PostgreSQL and MySQL for scalability’s 
    sake as well. Assignments inspired by real-world datasets.
